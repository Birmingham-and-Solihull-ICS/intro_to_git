# NHS BSOL ICS  Git and GitHub overview

These slides are an overview of Git and GitHub for analytical teams in BSOL ICS.
This is not a training session per se, but more an overview of the functionality with code to get started.


This is based on work I did at NHS North Central London ICB, so citing here:
